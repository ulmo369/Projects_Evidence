 # Computational Biology
 This was a project with the goal to represent a good differential Gene Expression, making different kinds of plots like volcan plot and box plot.
 With this we were able to conclude which type of colon cancer is more dangerous today, considering adults and adolescents.
 
 # Data Science
 Here I present 3 codes, in the first one I had to have done a code to process differente kind of information of any kind of persons, I decided to
 make a calculator of body mass index with the user information.
 In the second I used the Pandas library to process my own information from an Excel table, with this I could visualize what my weight will be if I
 continue with my diet.
 And in the third one, I did a real study of my information, there I presented important points of a data science study like the regression model or
 the root of the mean squared deviation.
 
 # Magnetism
 This is only an interface of a grafic representation of what would be the fall of a magnet on a magnetic field. Here we can make the grafic of the 
 electromotive force and flow, the position and the velocity
 
 # Object oriented programming 1
 The program is about a reservation to a restaurant, where you simply choose your food, drink and dessert, you also specify the payment and specify the
 branch and the time; the advantage would be that your food would already be at the time in the place that you decided.
 In this project I used these methods:
 * heritage
 * composition
 * abstraction
 
 # Object oriented programming 2
 This code shows a simulation of a fighting game in which you are the one who interacts to continue the fight. You will be a hero of any game and you
 will need to defeat the  Final Boss of that game, you only have a Tilt Attack and Smash Attack and you can fail the Tilt Attack or maybe it can be a 
 Critical Attack but there is only a 30% of having that; the Smash Attack will be charged every three turns, you have to consider that the boss also
 have a Smash attack and he has a 40% to hit, you have a 70%.
 The Boss Smash Attack = 100 and you can choose the Hero Smash Attack, maybe of 50 or maybe of 25
 When you and your opponent reach the %300 of damage the game will end.
 The winner will be the player that has less damage percentage
 
 In this project I used these methods:
 * Heritage
 * Composition
 * Abstraction
 * Pointers
 * Overwriting
 * Polimorfism

 # Web Programming
 Currently, due to the digital transformation, Natgas did not have an effective way to manage its IT projects, having to perform various actions manually without any type of  automated and intelligent software, thus wasting time due to the lack of automation of the process.

 They mainly use two platforms for the approach of their projects, Google Sheets or Excel where they propose the analysis of requirements and their prioritization, and then
 transfer them to Airtable to follow up on them and again copy the data to Excel to graph them, wasting a lot of time and adding manual work unnecessary.

 We take care of generating a tool that could connect data from Airtable with various functionalities that we present on our website. 
 
 # Lexer Scheme
 I had the job of making a lexer of the scheme language in c ++, this should receive an input.txt and generate its resulting color code.
 Html and css were used to color and present the resulting code.
 The regex library was used to solve this problem
 
 # Multiagents
 The project consists of proposing a solution to the problem of urban mobility in Mexico, through an approach that reduces vehicular congestion by graphically 
 simulating traffic, representing the output of a multi-agent system.
 my main job was working on the algorithm of the multi-agents system. This system was made in python, using mesa and pandas as the main libraries that helped make the 
 specifics calculus. This part was also programmed in an object-oriented programming method, creating three main classes: CarAgent, LightAgent, and StreetModel.

 CarAgent: Was programmed to stop if a car is in front of it or to die if it is out of the grid. The cars also have their own specific way to move.

 LightAgent: Has the specific algorithm for how the cars must wait or move for a good autosuficient.

 StreetModel: This class just represents the grid where the cars and lights have to be.
